# Hello, I'm Thanh Duc! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ“š About Me
I'm a 23 years old, an graduated IT major student with a passionate for coding and programming. I mainly code functions, programs or tools for my personal use, I am extremely familiar with **C#, python, JAVA**. I do know other coding languages and frameworks like Flutter, C++, HTML + CSS + Bootstrap, etc. (Please do keep in mind I am not exactly good at them)
My academic journey is not just about earning a degree, it's about immersing myself in the world of programming, and I want to make lives easier and much more automated :) The less we do, the better.

## ðŸ’» What I Do
- **Coding Hobbyist:** I usually made automated tools, or scripting for personal use. I really like a few projects, and I intend to replicate them and made my own customizations, this help me hones my skills and sharpen my creativity. You can find more about those projects in my repos :)
- **Lifelong Learner:** The quest for knowledge never ends. I'm constantly on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn, whether it's through formal education, self-study, or hands-on experience.
- **Winform Developer:** I am currently a full-time programmer at UHT company, which specializing in developing winform for intended purposes. This job is how I hone my skills in C# coding.
